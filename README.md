# raspberryPi
small repo for running my EC 444 code on my raspberry Pi.

index.js starts a server than can be accessed via danpi.hopto.org and the selected port number. It displays an html graph that reads from a served csv file,
both found in the public folder.

Access to server is now depreciated as other teammembers have altered the DDNS for the group router.

# Required Dependencies

Express, Node.
